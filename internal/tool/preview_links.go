// CreatePreviewLink mints a shareable device preview link for an app build.
var CreatePreviewLink = devenv.Tool{
	Definition: mcp.NewTool("bitrise_devenv_create_preview_link",
		mcp.WithDescription(`Turn an app build into a shareable link that opens the app on a live iOS simulator or Android emulator in the recipient's browser — no Bitrise login, no local tooling, nothing for them to install.

WHEN TO USE THIS: you have built an app and want a HUMAN to try it — a reviewer on a pull request, a designer checking a screen, a PM signing off. Hand them the url from the response.

WHEN NOT TO USE THIS: you want to drive a device YOURSELF (install, tap, screenshot, run tests). That is bitrise_devenv_create with device_spec — a session you control over adb / xcrun simctl. A preview link gives YOU nothing to drive; it only produces a URL for someone else.

Nothing is stored: the response is the only artifact, a link nobody opens costs nothing, and every open spawns its own device, so one link serves several reviewers at once.

THE APP BUILD (artifact.url) must be an absolute http(s) URL that a plain anonymous GET can fetch — a presigned URL is fine, and it is never shown to viewers. It must be a SIMULATOR/EMULATOR build, not a device build: iOS wants a zipped .app carrying an arm64 simulator slice, Android an .apk that runs on x86_64. A device-signed build installs on neither, and the viewer finds out only after a device has booted. If all you have is a device build, rebuild for the simulator/emulator first.

THE LINK IS A BEARER CREDENTIAL. Anyone holding the URL can open a device on this workspace's bill, and there is no revocation list — a short ttl_seconds is the control. Share it the way you would share a password: a pull request or a team channel, never a public one.

FASTER OPENS FROM A WARM POOL: pass warm_pool_id to serve the link's opens from a warm pool (bitrise_devenv_list_warm_pools) — each open claims one of the pool's booted device sessions when available and cold-boots from the pool's configuration otherwise, so click-to-app is the app download rather than a VM boot. The pool must be WORKSPACE-owned (owner_type "workspace"; a user pool's sessions carry personal credentials that must never reach an anonymous viewer) and its configuration must boot a device. The pool fixes the machine and the device: omit device_spec, stack_id and machine_type (device_spec may be given only if it equals the pool's device). A pool deleted after minting degrades later opens to the ordinary cold path.

LIMITS: ttl_seconds defaults to 24 hours, capped at 72. At most 5 devices alive per link and 20 per workspace; opens past the cap are refused. Each device auto-terminates after its idle window (session_auto_terminate_minutes, at least 10, default 60).

Returns url (the shareable link — this is what you hand over), token (the same credential bare), jti (the link's id, recorded on every session it spawns) and expires_at.

Device preview is enabled per workspace and per platform. PermissionDenied means the workspace does not have it yet — tell the user to ask Bitrise support, do not retry.`),
