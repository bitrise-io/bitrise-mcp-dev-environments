		mcp.WithDescription(`Get a point-in-time snapshot of the workspace's active devenv sessions: session counts and vCPU/memory totals split by OS, workspace-wide and per user.

This reports sessions currently consuming resources (starting, running, terminating, or draining). It is NOT a historical or billing-period report — poll it over time if you need trends.

Requires the workspace's billing-view permission (workspace owners and billing-managing custom roles); other members get a permission-denied error.

Response shape (zero-valued fields and empty objects may be omitted from the JSON — treat a missing field as 0/false/empty):
- totals: workspace-wide usage, split into linux, macos, and unknown (OS could not be determined) buckets. Each bucket has:
  - sessionCount: number of active sessions.
  - vcpu: total vCPUs across those sessions.
  - memoryGb: total memory in GB across those sessions.
- users: per-user breakdown, sorted by email. Each row has:
  - userSlug: the user's Bitrise slug, usable with other Bitrise APIs.
  - email / username: the user's identity (username is best-effort and may be empty).
  - userId: internal identifier; prefer userSlug for cross-referencing.
  - isWorkspace: true for the single aggregate row of workspace-owned sessions (created with a workspace API token rather than by a user); that row has no userSlug/email.
  - totals: this row's usage, same linux/macos/unknown bucket shape as the workspace-wide totals.
- unknownMachineTypeCount: number of active sessions whose machine type had no resolvable vCPU/RAM spec. Those sessions are counted in sessionCount but contribute 0 to the vcpu/memory sums, so totals undercount when this is non-zero — mention that caveat when presenting the numbers.`),
